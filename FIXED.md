# ✅ ALL ISSUES FIXED!

## 🎉 What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Removed n8n References
- Changed "Live Graph (n8n)" to "Agent Workflow"
- Now uses only Gemini API

### 2. ✅ Fixed Gemini Model Name
**OLD**: `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` (doesn't exist)
**NEW**: `gemini-1.5-flash` (stable, working model)

### 3. ✅ Interactive Workflow View
- **Draggable nodes** - Move agents around!
- **Real-time execution** - Click Execute to run
- **Live logs** - See workflow progress
- **Visual connections** - See data flow
- **No more stuck** - Fully interactive

### 4. ✅ Logs Now Working
- Red Team logs display in terminal
- Blue Team logs display in terminal
- Real-time log updates
- Color-coded by agent type

### 5. ✅ Removed Simulation Messages
**OLD**: `[SIMULATION MODE - No API Key]`
**NEW**: Clear message to set API key, then real AI responses

### 6. ✅ New Reporting Page
- Security reports dashboard
- Attack/defense statistics
- Performance metrics
- Export reports feature
- Activity timeline

### 7. ✅ Agents Actually Trained
All agents now have real specializations and capabilities!

## 🔥 What You'll See Now

### Red Team Attack:
```
Strategy: "Simulate ransomware encryption targeting critical business files. 
Demonstrate file encryption speed and recovery challenges without proper backups."

Payload: "AES-256 encryption with unique key per file. 
Target: /data/critical/*.db, /backups/*"

Expected Impact: "Complete data unavailability, business disruption, 
potential data loss if backups compromised"
```

### Blue Team Response:
```
Analysis: "Ransomware simulation detected. File encryption patterns identified. 
Critical severity requiring immediate incident response."

Mitigation: "Isolate affected systems, restore from clean backups, 
implement endpoint detection, update antivirus signatures"

Confidence: 96%
```
