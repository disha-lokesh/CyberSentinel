## 📝 If Still Getting Error:

If you still see a 404 error, it means your API key doesn't have access to Gemini 1.5 Pro.

### Try These Alternatives:

I can switch to:
- `gemini-1.5-flash-latest` (faster, lighter)
- `models/gemini-pro` (older but stable)
- `models/gemini-1.5-flash` (specific version)

Just let me know which one works with your API key! 👍
